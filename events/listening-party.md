We’re back! Come join us on Friday, February 6 from 3:00-4:00 p.m. in the Salter Reading Room (Humanities Centre 3-95) for the 2026 edition of the SpokenWeb Listening Party, inspired by the spirit of a certain earnest self-help author: "Others may schedule your hours, but the meaning of them is entirely yours."

At your request, we'll be spinning excerpts from our vast collection of rare vinyl literary recordings.
