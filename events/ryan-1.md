**I would suggest you prepare for updates from the team by figuring out how to:

1. How to make minor corrections to a page on Github.

2. How to add events and move existing events into the Archive.

3. How to generate and add a new Featured Exhibit.

3.1 How to add images. This will involve learning how to add the audio information so that the audio bar will play one or more tracks from Aviary.
