<h3>EPL on The Edge Speaker Series - The SpokenWeb Project: Archiving Literary Sound
</h3>



>Ever wonder what happened to all those reel-to-reel or cassette recordings made decades ago that were tucked into cardboard boxes? On university campuses across Canada, **thousands of recordings were made when visiting authors performed their work.** However, most of those recordings have never been made publicly available, until now. The Department of English and Film Studies at the University of Alberta has been a centre for literary activity and the organizer of countless literary events. **Many of those events were captured on audio tape, and our collection includes hundreds of recordings available for streaming.** These unique historical objects are not only important artifacts of cultural heritage, they’re also a valuable resource for scholars, teachers, students, and fans. Come join three members of SpokenWeb UAlberta’s research team to learn more about this exciting project.
