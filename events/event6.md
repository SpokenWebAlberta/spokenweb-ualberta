**Please join SpokenWeb UAlberta for the first in a series of special listening events to take place this Winter Term**. The series will feature SpokenWeb's local collection of unique historical recordings of literary performances in the Department of English and Film Studies. Each hour-long session will offer some of the highlights of the collection, capturing some very special moments in Edmonton's literary history. 

The sessions will take place in the Old Arts Student Lounge from 2:30-3:30 on the scheduled dates below. These will be, we hope, low-key, relaxing moments of listening and reflection, with a very short introduction and a few minutes of casual discussion to close things off.

**First up, on Friday, February 2nd**, is celebrated Canadian poet and former EFS Writer in Residence Phyllis Webb, introduced by our late friend and colleague Professor Douglas Barbour. Webb delivers an extraordinary performance of her work to a bustling room in the depths of winter some forty-three years ago. For more details, please see the poster below.

The series dates will be Friday **February 2, Friday March 1, Thursday April 4, Thursday May 2**. Please mark these on your calendars and encourage others to join in.



These events are supported by the Department of English and Film Studies and by SpokenWeb.
