**From 1980 to 1984, Jars Balan produced the campus radio shows <i>Voiceprint</i>, <i>Celebrations</i>, and <i>Paper Tygers</i> for the University of Alberta’s Radio and Television Department.** These series aired on CKUA, the Edmonton-based community radio station, and were broadcast across the province. Jars interviewed numerous Canadian literary stars, including Ann Cameron, Margaret Atwood, Bill Bisset, Stephen Scobie, and Douglas Barbour. 

**Balan was a master's student in UAlberta’s English Department when he was recruited by producer Roman Onufrijchuk** to help generate educational content for CKUA. Though a novice to radio, Balan found he had a knack for interviewing. He became skilled, as well, at audio editing and sound design, which in the pre-digital era was a hands-on process, involving cutting and splicing tape by hand using reel-to-reel decks.[^1]

Of the three radio shows Balan produced for RTV/CKUA, <i>Voiceprint</i> had the most popular appeal. The series explored contemporary art and culture through the lens of communications theory and earned a glowing review in The Edmonton Journal (Kostash). The <i>Celebrations</i> series, also hosted by Balan, marked the 75th anniversary of the University of Alberta and featured interviews and performances with writers-in-residence. Finally, <i>Paper Tygers</i> explored the ins and outs of the publishing industry, offering practical advice for aspiring authors.[^2][^3]

**Balan was not only a radio host, but a poet and performer in his own right**, who shared the stage with the likes of bpNichol, George Bowering, and Stephen Scobie. Paper Tygers was inspired by Balan’s experience as an artist-in-residence at The Banff Centre for Performing Arts.[^4]

**Today, Balan is best known for his work as an activist and leader in the Ukrainian community.** He is the former Director of the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies (CIUS) at the University of Alberta, a position he held from 2017-2020, and he currently serves as the administrative coordinator of the Peter and Doris Kule Ukrainian Canadian Studies Centre at CIUS.[^5] His editorials on the Russian invasion of the Ukraine have appeared in <i>The National Post</i>,[^6] <i>The Edmonton Journal</i>,[^7] and <i>The Conversation</i>.[^8] Though his days as a campus radio host are past, Balan never lost his love of radio and of literature, and lately he has been experimenting with visual poems that celebrate his Ukrainian heritage.
