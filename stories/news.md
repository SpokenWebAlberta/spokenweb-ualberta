## **"SpokenWeb UAlberta revives Edmonton’s literary soundscapes"**

Student-led project brings the city’s poetic past to life through immersive storytelling

November 06, 2025

> At the College of Social Sciences and Humanities’ first research celebration on October 16, 2025, the SpokenWeb 
> UAlberta team presented SpokenWeb UAlberta in 360°, an immersive audio-visual project by research assistants Natasha D’Amours and Sarah Freeman. Using virtual reality to revisit archival poetry recordings from the 1960s to 1980s in their original Edmonton venues, including the University of Alberta, the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, and the Art Gallery of Alberta, the project explores how technology can renew our understanding of sound, memory, and place. Many attendees lingered to rewatch the piece, remarking on how powerfully it brought to life the voices of poets such as Dorothy Livesay, Douglas Barbour, and Stephen Scobie, and how vividly it recreated the atmosphere of the city’s literary past.

Donna McKinnon 

Faculty of Arts, 03 August 2018


> When portable recording technology became widely available in the 1960s, people recorded everything from crying babies to private conversations. Across university campuses, literary events and author readings were recorded on reel to reel tapes and (later) audio cassettes, boxed away and for a variety of reasons, largely forgotten.
