## Sounding Literature

<hr>

This site is currently having it's deploy tested.

Welcome to The SpokenWeb at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. We're part of the larger SpokenWeb Network of researchers across Canada and the United States.

Our local site features literary sound events dating from 1957-1988 and recorded on reel-to-reel and cassette tape recorders in our region. The audio textual items in this collection are housed at The University of Alberta and made available through [UAlberta Library's Aviary Online Collection](https://ualberta.aviaryplatform.com/collections/1783).
